General:


    complete v3 architecture design: 
        ✔ The TradeEnv class seems about ready to be subclassed. @done(19-12-12 21:23)
        ✔ You need to determine any tweaks that need to be made to TradingAccount and Market. @done(19-12-14 22:34)
            TradingAccount seems like it already has everything needed to be passed to TradeEnv as it's "trader".
    
        ✔ update for below: Experiment class started - you should make the super class general, and then subclass for a TradingExperiment,, which expects and handles a by-bar training loop. @done(19-12-12 19:44)
            -You may still want to create an Experiment class which will contain the current main.py loop in a "run()" function, or something.
            -takes an agent and the env, and anything else required (e.g. nEpisodes)
            and handles the actual training process.
                -this class would provide the structure for training, and 
                handle all the extra stuff like terminal updates, timing, model saving, etc.
                -This could also be the uppermost class to handle reporting, taking it
                away from the environment responsibilities. 
                    -maybe env should still keep a relevant log, but experiment handles exporting and naming, etc.

                -should have either an overridable method or user can provide a callable method
                ... which is called at various parts of training to add custom functionality.
                ... e.g. on the "if done" part, or after each epoch.. that would allow the generic experiment class to still
                ... allow for things like calling replay on agents that need it, etc.

    The deepwell framework is concieved.

        ✔ finish RLExperiment abstract class .. should be compatible with @done(19-12-12 19:46)
            ...any generic RL training task (or most, don't get stuck)
            -(done)add user callback functions

        ✔ then, finish RLTradingExperiment class.. should inherit RLExperiment @done(19-12-12 19:47)
            ...and the run function should accomplish everything from v2's main.py loop.





current:

    ** YOU ARE HERE **
    - write a cool reward function and play around/test it a bit.. if you're going to design something, handle the reporting and the visualization.

    ✔ continue reconstructing main.py in new v3 architecture and test until it works @done(19-12-14 21:29)
        ✔ test the userMethodDict approach and the subclass approach @done(19-12-14 22:35)
            - for the subclass approach, you can create a reusable subclass for use with the DQNAgent.

        
later:

    - write out quick use case/mini docs on how to go about designing and setting up an experiment
        ...this should help highlight any flow issues and refresh your high level perspective

    - consider an experimentreporting class, or just a single dataframe which is passed to the various classes who each can handle their own reporting at a given bar?.. 

    - batch size should be contained in the DQN agent class

    - should probably extract the experiment-agnostic features from TradeEnv, and create a custom Environment super class - DeepwellEnvironemnt?

    - change "episode" naming convention to epoch

    - rethinking "custom user methods" dict approach in RLExperiment ... probably better to just subclass and add features via overriding... but test these anyway.. might be worth keeping the functionality
    ... But if you keep it, you may need to add similar functionality to Environment for consistent behavior

    - set RLTrade package up as a proper module so we can import from a parent dir
        ... need to resolve "attempted relative import with no known parent package" error
    


later non-mvp:
    TradingAccount:
        - redesign margin checks


non-mvp feature brainstorm:

    - might want to consider redesigning as lightweight as possible - You're currently trying to making things as robust and general as possible (as usual), but that is adding overhead.
        ... e.g., extra loops and stuff where there doesn't need to be... there is a trade off between user friendliness and efficiency; for example, in the Market class; everytime you call getAssetDataFeatures(),
        ... it will validate the assetIds, whether they're names, id's or a combination. This is cool and nice.. but unneccesary.. especially during development. It's better to understand and comply to a specific
        ... expected parameter and streamline performance.

    RLExperiment:
        - consider changing "done" and "onDone" to something like "onEpisodeFinish"

    TradingAccount:
        - allow getRealizedProfit to have a custom window - I was doing this now, but am skipping to not get bogged down.. also don't have a use case in mind where this is needed during mvp
            ... this should use the built in account log
            `def getRealizedPL(self, startBarNum=0, endBarNum=None)
            """ return difference in current accountValue(excluding unrealizedPL) from startBarNum to endBarNum; if endBarNum==None, current bar is used """
                if endBarNum==None: endBarNum = self.market.currentBarNum
                return ...`


Things User should know:
    RLExperiment:
        - whenever self.done == True, the currentEpisode will end.
        - if the rewardDict does not contain a reward for the current eventFlag, a reward of 0 will be returned;
